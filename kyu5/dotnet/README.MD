# Summary

this repository includes all of my completed code-katas from the
[CodeWars Csharp challenges](http://wwww.codewars.com) with a difficulty of
kyu5 or higher. [History of the term kyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%AB)

In addition, some of the challenges will be translated in VB.net

# Csharp coding challenges:

## kyu5

* Directions Reduction

## Best Travel

### Best Travel
* Descripton of Kata: The function chooseBestSum (or choose_best_sum or ...
  depending on the language) will take as parameters t (maximum sum of distances,
  integer >= 0), k (number of towns to visit, k >= 1) and ls (list of distances,
  all distances are positive or null integers and this list has at least one element).
  The function returns the "best" sum ie the biggest possible sum of k distances
  less than or equal to the given limit t, if that sum exists, or otherwise null or None.
* Difficulty: kyu5
